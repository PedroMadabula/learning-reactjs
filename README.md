What is React?
A: A JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces. 

Where do React Apps Run?
A: React apps run in the browser. They don't run on the server, this gives us a great advantage, things happen instantly since they happen in the user's browser. We don't have to wait for a server response to get a new page or to render something new.

Why React?
A: The UI state becomes difficult to manage. In bigger JavaScript applications. React helps writing maintainable, manageable and reusable pieces of code by building components in your website.

What are some React Alternatives?
